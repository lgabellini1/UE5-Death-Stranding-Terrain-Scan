# Death Stranding Terrain Scan in Unreal Engine 5

A gameplay implementation of the terrain scan mechanic from the 2019 game _Death Stranding_ in the Unreal Engine 5.

# General 

In _Death Stranding_, the player is able to cast a scan which outlines the terrain along the distance and leaves a set of
indicators which provide visual aid for terrain navigation.

The project consists of a demo map and a player character able to scan.

A detailed rundown of the effect's implementation, along with various footage examples, can be found on my portfolio page at

# Info

The project was developed for the Unreal Engine version 5.5.4 on Windows 11.

The inspiration of this project is due to the 
[GameDevBuddies YouTube channel video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrs4g4hj9HY&t=2s), which this implementation is 
based upon. The demo landscape is provided by [STF3d](https://stf3d.de/landscape-pro/).
